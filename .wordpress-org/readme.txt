== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use your plugin to transliterate my latin content into cyrillic? =

Short answer: No.

Long Answer: At the moment, no. Such conversions are very hard to do since HTML language is also written in latin script, and converting text only is very resource intensive process.

I'm currently  working on a tool which will enable you to convert your latin content into cyrillic

= How can I keep parts of content in cyrilic? =

You can use [stl_cyr][/stl_cyr] shortcode. This will keep the shortcode text in cyrilic script, even when viewing latin version of the site.

= Will this plugin transliterate my page title into latin as well? =

Yes, it will.

= Will this plugin enable my visitors to search for content using latin script =

Yes it will. Plugin hooks into default WordPress search function and enables searching of cyrilic content using latin text on frontend

= Is this plugin Compatible with WPML =

Yes it is. It has no compatibility issues with WPML, since the transliteration core is being used only in serbian version of the website

= Will I be able to select script for Serbian language in WPML language Widget? =

Yes, Plugin fully integrates with all WPML functions on the frontend because it directly extends the available language list

= I'm having search issues - not all posts show up when searching for them using latin characters =

Open a support thread, or send me an e-mail.

= Your plugin is converting my cyrilic filenames into latin which prevents them from loading =

First - you shouldn't be using cyrilic filenames in the first place. Due to the fact that most hosting providers do not have full UTF-8 support.

I'm working on a tool which will convert filenames and post / page content on your website, so the errors will be automagically fixed

Temporary fix: redownload all attachments with cyrilic filenames and reupload them. This plugin will do an on-the-fly conversion of filenames.

= Will this plugin transliterate dynamic content (ajax) =

Yes it will. Option was added in version 2.4

= Some parts of my page aren't being transliterated =

Depending on the theme / plugins you're currently using, some content might be generated via REST API (wp-json). I'm working on adding the functionality to transliterate REST calls

Feel free to contact me via e-mail, and I'll see if I can assist you for your specific case.
